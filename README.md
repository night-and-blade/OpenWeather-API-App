# Weather App with Node.js and React
This project is a weather application built using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. 
It allows users to search for the weather of a city using the OpenWeather API. 
The application also supports date range filtering for historical weather data, unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and weather forecasts for the next 7 days. 
The app is responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices and screen sizes. API keys are securely managed, and caching mechanisms improve performance by reducing API calls.
