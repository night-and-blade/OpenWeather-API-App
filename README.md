This Weather Forecasting App allows users search locations by city name and observe the weather for the next 5-6 days and 3 hour interval.
<br />
The app is developed using React.js and material-UI.
<br/>
This app utilises **OpenWeather API** to fetch weather data for various cities and **GeoDB API** from Rapid API platform to list all valid cities.

## IMPORTANT NOTE TO REVIEWER OF THIS PROJECT

- I have intentionally not added both the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` and `RAPID_API_KEY` in a seperate .env file for the sake of convenience.
- So that you don't have to generate your own keys and can simply clone this repo
- However, if you still wish to do this you can visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/), to Sign Up and generate your own keys.
